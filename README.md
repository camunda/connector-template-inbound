# Inbound Connector Template

Camunda Inbound Connector Template

## Build

You can package the Connector by running the following command:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This will create the following artifacts:

- A thin JAR without dependencies.
- An uber JAR containing all dependencies, potentially shaded to avoid classpath conflicts. This will not include the SDK artifacts since those are in scope `provided` and will be brought along by the respective Connector Runtime executing the Connector.

### Shading dependencies

You can use the `maven-shade-plugin` defined in the [Maven configuration](./pom.xml) to relocate common dependencies
that are used in other Connectors and the [Connector Runtime](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/spring-zeebe/tree/master/connector-runtime#building-connector-runtime-bundles).
This helps avoiding classpath conflicts when the Connector is executed. 

Use the `relocations` configuration in the Maven Shade plugin to define the dependencies that should be shaded.
The [Maven Shade documentation](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/examples/class-relocation.html) 
provides more details on relocations.

## API

### Connector Properties

This Connector can be configured with the following properties:

| Name | Description | Example | Can be a secret |
| - | - | - | - |
| sender | Value of the `sender` field of the messages generated by [`MockSubscription`](https://github.com/camunda/connector-template-inbound/blob/main/src/main/java/io/camunda/connector/inbound/subscription/MockSubscription.java) | `Alice` | Yes |
| messagesPerMinute | How many messages per minute should MockSubscription produce (1-10) | `3` | No |

### Output

This Connector produces the following output:

```json
{
  "event": {
    "sender": ".....",
    "message": ".....",
    "code": 999
  }
}
```

## Test locally

Run unit tests

```bash
mvn clean verify
```

### Test with local runtime

Use the [Camunda Connector Runtime](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/spring-zeebe/tree/master/connector-runtime#building-connector-runtime-bundles) to run your function as a local Java application.

In your IDE you can also simply navigate to the `LocalContainerRuntime` class in test scope and run it via your IDE.
If necessary, you can adjust `application.properties` in test scope.

## Element Template

The element templates can be found in the [element-templates/inbound-template-connector.json](element-templates/inbound-template-connector.json) file.
